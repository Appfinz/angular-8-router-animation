Angular 8 Router Animation 
Animations in Angular are implemented inside components using a set of functions (trigger, state, animate, transition, style) from the @angular/animations package. Animation styles are defined using CSS rules, but they are defined in TypeScript using JSON objects instead of CSS/LESS files, there is also an Angular Animation DSL (Domain Specific Language) for controlling different states and transitions between states.
